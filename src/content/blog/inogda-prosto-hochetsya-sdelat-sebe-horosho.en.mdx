For example, quickly write a [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lirik.empty-folders-remover) that removes empty folders in your project. Then, after searching the extension marketplace, be even more surprised that no one has made such an extension yet.

And there's no such feature out of the box. Looks like me and 111 other people have a need to quickly remove empty folders in a project.
