## Interface

![Features](../../assets/vinyls/features.png)

### Home

Structured as a dashboard with key stats and summaries about the collection.

### Interactive widgets

Every key widget on the Home page is interactive. The timeline shows how the collection grows. The stats widget highlights records and builds charts automatically. An interactive map shows where each record was purchased.

### Collection mode

Collection mode is a table view for power users: categorisation, filters, tags, statuses, notes, and more.

### UI kit and design system

A unified design system with components, tokens, typography, and states.

### Landing page

The landing page was built with Next.js and a custom design system. It includes an interactive product tour, highlights the service, and explains the pricing plans.

## Result

The outcome is a cohesive, intuitive, and powerful interface for managing a vinyl collection.
